# Project 1 

**Title:** [Ecommerce Customer Behaviour Dashboard](https://github.com/IsraelAmogo/israelamogo.github.io/blob/main/ecommerce_customer_behavior_dashboard.xlsx)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Slicers, Pivot Chart, Pivot Tables, Piecharts, Area line, Barchars)

**Project Description:**
This project focused on analysing customer behavioural data for an e-commerce company to uncover trends and patterns in sales performance during 2023. The objective was to deliver a comprehensive overview of key performance metrics through an interactive dashboard, enabling stakeholders to monitor and evaluate purchasing behaviours across multiple dimensions, including device type, payment method, product category, age group, and cities.
The dashboard provides:
1. Shopping Sessions by Device Type: Pie chart visualisation of sessions segmented by device type.
2. Sales Distribution by Product Category: Pie chart breakdown of total sales by category, highlighting product performance.
3. Customer Gender Distribution: Gender-based segmentation to support targeted product strategies.
4. Sales Revenue by Customer Age Group: Revenue analysis across age demographics, identifying high-value segments.
5. Monthly Sales vs. Discounts: Comparative view of sales and discounts across months to assess correlation.
6. City-Level Sales and Discounts: Bar chart analysis of regional performance, illustrating the impact of discounts on city-level sales.
  
The Interactive slicers further enhance usability, allowing stakeholders to filter data by gender, device type, payment method, and product category, enabling deeper exploration of customer behaviour and product performance.

**Key findings:**
1. Regional Performance: Certain cities consistently generate higher sales and discounts, revealing concentrated demand and opportunities for region-specific strategies.
2. Seasonal Trends: Sales and discounts peak in the final quarter, underscoring the importance of holiday-focused marketing campaigns.
3. Top-Performing Categories: Electronics, Home & Garden, Sports, and Fashion lead overall sales, while Food and Books contribute less, guiding inventory and promotional priorities.
4. Customer Demographics: Gender distribution is balanced (Female: 50%, Male: 49%). The average customer age is 35, with the 30–39 age group driving the highest revenue.
5. Device Usage: Mobile devices account for 56% of shopping sessions, highlighting the need for mobile optimisation and app-based engagement strategies.
6. Sales Volatility: Monthly fluctuations in sales reflect dynamic market behaviour, reinforcing the need for adaptive pricing and discount policies.

**Impact:**

This dashboard serves as a strategic decision-making tool for the management team, providing clear, actionable insights into customer behaviour, product performance, and regional trends. By consolidating complex data into an intuitive visual format, it empowers stakeholders to make evidence-based decisions, optimise marketing efforts, and refine operational strategies for sustained growth.
